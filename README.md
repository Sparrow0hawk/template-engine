Based on [this blog post](https://blog.spike.codes/build-a-template-engine) with some edits.

## Building and testing

After cloning this repository you can build this library using [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/index.html).

```bash
$ cd template-engine

$ cargo build --lib
```

You can also run the test suite using `cargo`:

```bash
$ cd template-engine
